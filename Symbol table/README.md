# Symbol Table

### AIM

To write a program to implement symbol table operations.

### ALGORITHM

STEP 1:Start the program

STEP 2:Include user defined header file “double_hashing.h” to implement functions.

STEP 3:Class sym is defined to store the row of symboltable(identifier,datatype,scope,no of line) and class SymbolTable as friend class to perform operation on symboltable and pointer array of class symbol type of size 100 to store content of symbol table

STEP 4:METHODS OF Class SymbolTable

INSERTION:To insertion the content in symbol table by using double hashing techique by using sum of ascii key code of identifier as input for hashing function.

DELETION:To delete the content of symbol table for given identifier.

LOOKUP:To lookup a content of a identifier for provided identifier.

MODIFY:To modify the content of given identifier.

METHOD OF Class sym
PRINT:TO display the content of symbol table.

STEP 5:In main function,do while and switch used to perform operations on symbol table.

STEP 6:Stop the program
